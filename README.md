# ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Latest Power BI Project: Financial Overview Dashboard ðŸ’¼ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my Financial Overview Project built using Microsoft Power BI! This interactive dashboard is designed to turn complex financial data into clear, actionable insights using a range of dynamic visual elements:

### âœ¨ Key Visuals & Features:

- ***Cards***, ***Line Charts***, ***Bar Graphs***, ***Donut Charts***, ***Tables***, ***Buttons*** and ***Images*** for intuitive storytelling
- ***Interactive Filter Panel:*** Created using Bookmarksâ€”clicking the filter button reveals a slicers pane
- ***Custom DAX Logic:*** Displays how many filters are active and lists them dynamically
- ***Creative Tooltip Pages:*** Offer drill-through insights for a seamless user experience

This project is a great example of how design meets functionality in business intelligence. It was both a technical and creative challenge, and Iâ€™m proud of the final result!

ðŸ”§ ***Tools & Techniques:*** Power BI, DAX, UX-focused dashboard design, Bookmark navigation, and custom tooltips.
